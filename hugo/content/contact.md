Below are my preferred contact methods in order of preference. Most of them are end to end encrypted allowing for greater privacy for both users.

* [Matrix](https://matrix.org/): @patrick:patrickcking.chat
* [Signal](https://www.signal.org/): +15038054667
* E-Mail: patrick@patrickcking.com
    * Please use PGP/MIME. My public email subkey can be found [here](/email.key).
* [Keybase](https://keybase.io): [keybase://chat/king](keybase://chat/king)
* SMS Text Message
* Phone Calls

Other forms of communication should be encrypted with my GPG public key ([0x2A590EC935F55DB1](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0x2A590EC935F55DB1&fingerprint=on&op=index)) if you want our communication to remain encrypted.
