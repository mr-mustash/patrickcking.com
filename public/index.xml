      <title>GPG Key Transition Statement</title>

      <description>I have created a new GPG Key 0x944E36F397047609 and will be transitioning away from my old key. I have also learned that ProtonMail (my provider) requires a primary key for management. As this is not something I am willing to give them, there will be a mismatch between my keys for email and everything else. You can find my new ProtonMail public key here.
If you have signed my previous key I would appreciate signatures on my new key as well.</description>

      <description>After many years of owning www.patrickcking.com and really doing nothing with it, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that it&amp;rsquo;s time to make use of this domain. This decision comes as a time when I am preparing to leave all social media websites and I am trying to find the least disruptive way to do so. The main drive to build this site is for my contact and event pages which I hope will allow me to keep in touch with my friends and continue to organize parties.</description>
