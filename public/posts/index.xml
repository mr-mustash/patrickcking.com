            <description>I have created a new GPG Key 0x944E36F397047609 and will be transitioning away from my old key. I have also learned that ProtonMail (my provider) requires a primary key for management. As this is not something I am willing to give them, there will be a mismatch between my keys for email and everything else. You can find my new ProtonMail public key here.
If you have signed my previous key I would appreciate signatures on my new key as well.</description>

OpenPGP Key Transition Statement for Patrick King

I have created a new OpenPGP key and will be transitioning away from
my old key.  The old key has not been compromised and will continue to
be valid for some time, but I prefer all future correspondence to be
encrypted to the new key, and will be making signatures with the new
key going forward.

The old key, which I am transitioning away from, is:

pub   rsa4096/0x2A590EC935F55DB1 2014-04-11 [SCEA] [expires: 2024-04-08]
      Key fingerprint = 269E 87A8 B0E4 EA16 ABF6  1101 2A59 0EC9 35F5 5DB1

The new key, to which I am transitioning, is:

pub   rsa4096/0x944E36F397047609 2021-02-23 [C]
      Key fingerprint = 228D FBBB A5E9 71D5 C3C6  31BE 944E 36F3 9704 7609

The entire key may be downloaded from: https://www.patrickcking.com/228DFBBBA5E971D5C3C631BE944E36F397047609.asc

To fetch the full new key from a public key server using GnuPG, run:

  gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --recv-key 228DFBBBA5E971D5C3C631BE944E36F397047609

If you already know my old key, you can now verify that the new key is
signed by the old one:

  gpg --check-sigs 228DFBBBA5E971D5C3C631BE944E36F397047609

If you are satisfied that you've got the right key, and the User IDs
match what you expect, I would appreciate it if you would sign my key:

  gpg --sign-key 228DFBBBA5E971D5C3C631BE944E36F397047609

You can upload your signatures to a public keyserver directly:

  gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --send-key 228DFBBBA5E971D5C3C631BE944E36F397047609

Or email patrick@patrickcking.com (possibly encrypted) the output from:

  gpg --armor --export 228DFBBBA5E971D5C3C631BE944E36F397047609

If you'd like any further verification or have any questions about the
transition please contact me directly.

To verify the integrity of this statement:

  wget -q -O- https://www.patrickcking.com/key-transition-2021-02-23.txt|gpg --verify

- -- Patrick

            <description>After many years of owning www.patrickcking.com and really doing nothing with it, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that it&amp;rsquo;s time to make use of this domain. This decision comes as a time when I am preparing to leave all social media websites and I am trying to find the least disruptive way to do so. The main drive to build this site is for my contact and event pages which I hope will allow me to keep in touch with my friends and continue to organize parties.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After many years of owning <a href="http://www.patrickcking.com">www.patrickcking.com</a> and really doing nothing with it, I&rsquo;ve decided that it&rsquo;s time to make use of this domain. This decision comes as a time when I am preparing to leave all social media websites and I am trying to find the least disruptive way to do so. The main drive to build this site is for my <a href="/contact">contact</a> and <a href="/event">event</a> pages which I hope will allow me to keep in touch with my friends and continue to organize parties.</p>
<p>Besides leaving social media, building this website was fun! I learned about <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> a little over a month ago and was immediately intrigued by the promise of a distributed web. Looking for the best way to do that I found <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/distributed-web/ipfs-gateway">Cloudflare&rsquo;s IPFS Gateway</a> and immediately started to port all of my sites over to use it. At the time this page was just a static html file that said &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; so it was pretty easy to do. To serve a more complicated website I would need a relative-linked website (since there is no DNS in IPFS) and I found <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> which was just perfect! Not only was it written in golang, but you could write everything in markdown.</p>
<p>So, here we are. The first blog post of my new IPFS hosted, Hugo website. I don’t know if I’ll do much on this blog, but it’s nice to know that I have somewhere to post content if I need to.</p>
