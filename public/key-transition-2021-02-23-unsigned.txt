OpenPGP Key Transition Statement for Patrick King

I have created a new OpenPGP key and will be transitioning away from
my old key.  The old key has not been compromised and will continue to
be valid for some time, but I prefer all future correspondence to be
encrypted to the new key, and will be making signatures with the new
key going forward.

The old key, which I am transitioning away from, is:

pub   rsa4096/0x2A590EC935F55DB1 2014-04-11 [SCEA] [expires: 2024-04-08]
      Key fingerprint = 269E 87A8 B0E4 EA16 ABF6  1101 2A59 0EC9 35F5 5DB1

The new key, to which I am transitioning, is:

pub   rsa4096/0x944E36F397047609 2021-02-23 [C]
      Key fingerprint = 228D FBBB A5E9 71D5 C3C6  31BE 944E 36F3 9704 7609

The entire key may be downloaded from: https://www.patrickcking.com/228DFBBBA5E971D5C3C631BE944E36F397047609.asc

To fetch the full new key from a public key server using GnuPG, run:

  gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --recv-key 228DFBBBA5E971D5C3C631BE944E36F397047609

If you already know my old key, you can now verify that the new key is
signed by the old one:

  gpg --check-sigs 228DFBBBA5E971D5C3C631BE944E36F397047609

If you are satisfied that you've got the right key, and the User IDs
match what you expect, I would appreciate it if you would sign my key:

  gpg --sign-key 228DFBBBA5E971D5C3C631BE944E36F397047609

You can upload your signatures to a public keyserver directly:

  gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --send-key 228DFBBBA5E971D5C3C631BE944E36F397047609

Or email patrick@patrickcking.com (possibly encrypted) the output from:

  gpg --armor --export 228DFBBBA5E971D5C3C631BE944E36F397047609

If you'd like any further verification or have any questions about the
transition please contact me directly.
